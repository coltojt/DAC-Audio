  <h2>General Policies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimum bench/estimate fee</strong> is required at drop-off. (<a href="services.html">See Services page</a> for details.)</li> 
    <li><strong>Unclaimed items:</strong> Equipment not picked up within <strong>30 days</strong> of service completion (or declined service) will incur a <strong>$5/day storage fee</strong> for up to 60 days. After 60 days, items are considered <strong>abandoned</strong> and may be sold or disposed of by Digital Analogue Creations.</li>  
    <li><strong>Storage fees</strong> cannot be waived once applied.</li>   
    <li><strong>Outstanding invoices</strong> may be sent to collections. If small claims court is required, legal fees and lost wages will be added to the balance.</li>    
    <li>Equipment left more than <strong>60 days</strong> after repair completion with an unpaid balance becomes property of <strong>Digital Analogue Creations</strong>. To surrender an item, request and complete a <strong>surrender form</strong> (available in person or via email). Diagnosis fees still apply.</li>   
    <li><strong>Repairs over $100 in parts</strong> require full prepayment of parts and shipping before repair begins. Labor is due at pickup.</li>    
    <li><strong>Returned checks/e-checks</strong> will incur a <strong>$90 service fee.</strong></li>   
    <li><strong>Estimates:</strong> If the final repair cost is within <strong>10%</strong> of the original estimate, we may proceed to expedite service. If it exceeds that range, weâ€™ll pause and provide a revised estimate. If declined, you'll be charged for work and parts up to that point.</li>
