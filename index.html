      <h2 style="color: black;">About</h2>
      <p>My name is Colton Tucker, and I am the craftsman and technician behind DAC Audio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I’m obsessed with vacuum tube amplification and analog audio technology—an art that’s fading fast. My work is dedicated to preserving it.</p>
 <p>I build hand-wired, point-to-point vacuum tube amplifiers with precision, intention, and respect for classic audio engineering. Every amp is tested thoroughly, voiced carefully, and built to sing for a lifetime.</p>

  audio equipment and electronics here in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Whether your amp is noisy, weak, cutting out, or ready for a
  full overhaul, I offer careful bench work with a focus on tone, reliability, and longevity.
